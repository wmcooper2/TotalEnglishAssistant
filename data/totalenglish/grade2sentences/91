Hello, everyone.
I'm going to talk about my dream.
I want to become a great soccer player in the future.
I'm good at playing soccer.
I practice soccer after school every day.
I watch a soccer game on TV almost every evening.
My dream is to become a great soccer player like Kazu.
I will play in the World Cup some day.
I hope my dream will come true.
I will try very hard to become a great soccer player.
Thank you.
I like playing soccer, too.
What team do you like?
What team do you want to be on?
Is the practice tough?
Good luck!
You'll become a great soccer player.
