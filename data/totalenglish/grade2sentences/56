Excuse me.
How can I get to the post office?
Go along this street, and turn left at the first corner.
Then, turn right at the next corner.
You'll find it on your left.
Thank you.
You're welcome.
I'm looking for a post office.
Is there a post office near here?
It's a ten-minute walk.
I'm lost.
Sorry, I'm afraid I don't know.
I'm not from around here.
I'm new here.
