When you called me last night, I was reading a book about many different gestures in the U.S. and Japan.

But Americans usually put a hand on their chest.
Many Japanese people make a peace sign when they take a picture.
But Americans usually don't use that gesture.

I think American gestures and Japanese gestures have very different meanings.

Japanese people put a hand on their chest when they say "yes."
Americans usually don't make a peace sign when they take a picture.
Mina thinks Americans and Japanese use very different gestures.
What were you studying at 10:00 yesterday morning?
What were you doing yesterday evening?
I think that my friends are important to me.
I get up early when I practice tennis at school in the morning.
