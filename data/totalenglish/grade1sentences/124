Dear Mr. White, Hello.
My name is Fujita Taku.
I am in class 1C.
I really enjoyed your class.
You brought some pictures from Australia.
We talked about the animals there.
I went to the zoo the other day.
I saw kangaroos and koalas there!
Please send more pictures to us some day.
Take care.
Sincerely, Fujita Taku.
