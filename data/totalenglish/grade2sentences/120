Hello, everyone.
Today, I'm going to show you my treasure.
It is this gold medal.
I got this gold medal in a soccer tournament last fall.
It is my first gold medal.
It doesn't look so special, but for me, it is my treasure.
Our team was not so strong, but we practiced a lot every day and never gave up.
I will keep this medal all my life.
Thank you.
