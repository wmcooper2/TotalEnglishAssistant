Lisa asks Joey again, "How well do you know her?"
He answers, "Pretty well. We are in the same lab group."
Now she is excited.
"You mean OUR group!? So, it's Jenny or Kate."
Joey says nothing.
Lisa thinks for a while and says, "Jenny is very cute. Kate is kind and friendly. Which one? Can I call and tell her?"
Joey knows the girl pretty well.
Joey and the girl are in the same lab group.
Lisa, Jenny and Kate are not in the same lab group.
Joey says, "Kate is kind and friendly."
