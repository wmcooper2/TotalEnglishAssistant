Sister Teresa opened a house for the dying and, after that, another house for children without families.
Sister Teresa loved everyone like a mother, and so her name changed to Mother Teresa.
One day, Mother Teresa found a dying man.
No one would go near him because he was very sick.
Mother Teresa and her friends took care of him.
The man asked, "Why are you helping me?"
Mother Teresa answered, "Because I love you."
She once explained, "If you feel that no one loves you, it is true starvation."
Sister Teresa opened two houses.
One was for the sick, and the other was for children without families.
Teresa's name changed to Mother Teresa because she loved everyone like a mother.
