Excuse me. Will we arrive at 3:50?
No, we won't.
We'll arrive at 3:15.
Are you traveling by yourself?
Yes.
I'm so excited.
You're a brave boy!
Will they serve lunch soon?
Yes, they will.
But I won't have it.
I'm not hungry.
Really?
I'm very hungry.
I'll give my meal to you then.
Oh, thank you!
What will the woman give to Hiro?
