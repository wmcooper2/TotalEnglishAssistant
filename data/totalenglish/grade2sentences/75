I like to sing and talk with kids, so today I went to a nursery school for my career experience.
First, I had a meeting with the teachers to talk about today's class.
We had a lot of things to do.
When I saw many kids, I was excited.
One cheerful kid said to me, "Hello!" in a loud voice.
They were friendly to me.
At the end of the day, they said, "Thank you and goodbye."
I enjoyed my career experience.
I want to be a nursery school teacher in the future.
