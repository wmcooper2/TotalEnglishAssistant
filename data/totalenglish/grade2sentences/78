I'm Elena Kessler.
I came to Japan from Germany last month.
Living in Japan in exciting.
I enjoy learning about Japanese culture and customs.
The other day, I learned the Japanese word mottainai.
I think it's a great word.
It's similar to the idea of the 3Rs.
Does anyone know the 3Rs?
They mean reducing, reusing and recycling.
What are the 3Rs?
