Some children were playing in the village.
Suddenly, Blue Demon came.
He shouted, "Get out of here, or I'll hurt you."
The children were afraid and cried, "Help us!"
Then, Red Demon come and shouted, "Go away!"
Blue Demon whispered, "Hit me hard."
It's OK.
Red Demon hit Blue Demon, and Blue Demon ran away.
Thank you for saving us.
You're very strong and kind.
"Let's play together!" the children said.
They went to Red Demon's house and played together.
First, I will go in front of the children, and they will scream.
Then, you come and hit me, and I will go away.
You will scare the children.
They will be your friends and play with you.
