My friends and I went to a supermarket to work for a day.
First, we had a morning meeting and practiced greetings.
After that, we went to the fruit and vegetables section to package new vegetables.
Then we put them on the stands.
All the vegetables looked nice and fresh.
A customer asked me, "Where are the bananas?"
I showed the way to her, and she said, "Thank you."
I was happy.
I really enjoyed my day today.
What did Miku do during the morning meeting?
