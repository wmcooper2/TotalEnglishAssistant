Hi, Mike.
You look sleepy today.
I came home at 10:00 last night.
Oh, where were you?
I was at my uncle's house.
We watched a movie there.
Was it interesting?
Yes, it was.
I enjoyed it.
You look happy today.
Look at this picture.
I made this cake for my family yesterday.
Wow!
It looks delicious.
Yes.
My family really liked it.
