Where does Ms. Allen teach English?
What time does Ms. Allen go to bed?
Ms. Allen gets up at six every morning, and then she washes her face.
I take a bath after dinner.
I love bath time.
I get dressed before breakfast.
I go home by train.
I read a book on the train.
I listen to music and go to bed at eleven o'clock.
