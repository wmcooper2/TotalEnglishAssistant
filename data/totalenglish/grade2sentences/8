Last Sunday, my husband and I went to Tokyo.
In the morning, we visited a sumo stable and watched a sumo wrestlers' practice.
It was very exciting!
The sumo wrestlers were big, tall and powerful.
After that, we ate chankonabe, sumo wrestlers' stew.
In the afternoon, we walked along the Sumida River.
We came home at about 5 o'clock.
I was a wonderful day.
Where did Ms. Allen and her husband visit in the morning?
