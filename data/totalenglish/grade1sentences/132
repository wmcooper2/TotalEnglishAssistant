Hello, everyone.
This is my racket.
My mother bought it for me last April.
I use it almost every day.
This racket is light, so I can play tennis well.
I won a match with it last month.
I like it very much.
Thank you.
Where did your mother buy the racket?

Are you good at tennis?
Who is your favorite tennis player?
