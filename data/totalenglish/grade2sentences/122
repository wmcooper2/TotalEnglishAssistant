My grandmother gave me this mirror last fall.
The mirror was a present for my fourteenth birthday.
The mirror is very old, older than me, and it is special to me.
My grandfather bought my grandmother this mirror when they had their first baby, my father.
If I get married and have a daughter in the future, I'll give her this mirror.
Until then, I will take care of it.
