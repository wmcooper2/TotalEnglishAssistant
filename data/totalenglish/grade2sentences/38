Ladies and gentlemen.
We are going to pass out the landing cards soon.
Please fill them out.
We can answer any questions for you.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
What do I write here?
Just write your hotel address.
I'm not going to stay at a hotel.
I'm going to stay at my aunt's house.
OK.
Write her address, then.
Oh, I see.
Thank you.
What did Hiro receive?
