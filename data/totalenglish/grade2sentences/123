Hello, everyone.
Today, I'm going to show you my treasure.
It is this old mirror.
My grandmother gave me this mirror last fall.
It was a present for my fourteenth birthday.
This mirror is very old, older than me, and it is special to me.
My grandfather bought it for my grandmother when they had their first baby, my father.
If I get married and have a daughter in the future, I'll give her this mirror.
Until then, I will take care of it.
Thank you.
How old is your grandmother?
Is she fine?
Do you live with her?
Do you always have the mirror?
