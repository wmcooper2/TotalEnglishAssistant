I have a French friend Manon.
She is as old as me.
She loves manga and anime very much.
She sent me an e-mail yesterday.
Hi Seema, how's Japan?
I'm reading "One Piece" now.
I bought the latest volume at a bookstore in Paris yesterday.
"One Piece" is on TV, too.
I enjoy it as much as the manga.
Please say hi to your friends for me!
Bye for now, Manon.
Where did Manon buy the latest volume of "One Piece"?
