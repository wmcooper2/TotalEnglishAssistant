Do you have to work tomorrow, Mika?
No, I don't.
How about you?
I don't have to work, either.
Shall we go to Paris, then?
Great idea.
Let's take the Eurostar.
Sounds exciting!
How long does it take to Paris by Eurostar?
About two hours and 15 minutes.
That's close!
Let's go to the Eiffel Tower.
OK.
But you mustn't stay up late tonight.
We have to leave early tomorrow morning.
