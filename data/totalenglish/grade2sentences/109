I'll talk about two World Heritage Sties in Japan.
The are Horyu-ji and Himeji-jo.
Horyu-ji is one of the oldest temples in Japan.
It's very big and very beautiful.
The temple and other buildings in Nara are the first World Heritage Sites in Japan.
Himeji-jo is also a popular World Heritage Site in Japan.
A lot of people visit Himeji-jo all year round.

I think that both of them are beautiful.
