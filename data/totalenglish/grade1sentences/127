Lisa is surprised.
"Wow! Who is she!?"
Joey looks at her and says, "I can't tell you."
Lisa doesn't give up.
"Well, can I guess? When did you first meet her?"
Joey answers, "Last September."
"Where did you meet her?" Lisa asks.
"In our science class," Joey says.
"Really? Then I know her, right?" she grins.
