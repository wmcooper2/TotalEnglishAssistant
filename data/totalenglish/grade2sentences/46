Excuse me.
What's the lunch special for today?
It's roast beef with Yorkshire pudding.
It comes with soup.
Could you explain Yorkshire pudding, please?
Sure.
It's soft, fluffy, round bread.
Sounds good.
I'll have it.
Would you like a drink?
Yes.
I'll have tea.
Shall I bring it now or after the meal?
Now, please.
