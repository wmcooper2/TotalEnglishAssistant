Do you like football?
American football?
No, no.
Football means "soccer" in British English.
Really?
I love soccer.
So do I.
Let's go to a football match this afternoon.
Sounds great!
I'm excited.
Good.
But first we must go shopping.
We have to buy some food for dinner.
OK, Uncle Jim.
How do we get to the stadium?
By tube.
Tube?
Yes, you know, the underground.
Oh, I see! You mean the subway.
What does tube mean in American English?
