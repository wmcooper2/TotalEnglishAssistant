I like Japanese movies.
I often watch old Japanese movies on TV and on DVD here in Japan.
I like Kurosawa's movies.
I like "Seven Samurai" the best.
I hear Kitano's movies are the most famous Japanese movies in Paris.
But I like Kurosawa's movies better than Kitano's.
I'm interested in anime, too.
My brother Roy likes Western animation better than anime.
But I think anime is as interesting as Western animation.
If you have any questions about Japanese movies, please ask me.

Anna thinks Kurosawa's movies are the most famous Japanese movies in Paris.

Which anime do you like the best?
Which do you like better, Japanese movies or American movies?
If you want to know about sumo, you should ask Mr. Sato.
