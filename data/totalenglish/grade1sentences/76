This is a picture of lunch time.
Oh, lunch time!
Tell us about it.
OK.
Students eat lunch in the cafeteria.
Some students bring their own lunch.
What do they bring?
Sandwiches, fruit, snacks and drinks.
Snacks, too?
That's interesting.
Look.
This is my uncle.
His students like him very much.
They sometimes play basketball with him after lunch.
Where do students eat lunch in the U.S.?
