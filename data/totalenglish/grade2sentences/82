Wow, what a big hole!
But when it's full, you must find another place to put the garbage, right?
How long can we keep putting our garbage in it?
At first, we thought we could use it only until 2020.
But now we think we can use it until 2030.
Why do you think so?
Because people try to reduce their garbage these days.
They sort and recycle plastic bottles, cans, paper and many other things.
That leads to saving resources, too!
Why do they think that they can use the hole until 2030?
