Here is a message from Mr. Suzuki.
At first, I was afraid when I spoke English, but not anymore.
When I speak English, I speak clearly and use simple words.
When I don't understand, I always ask questions.
Now I use English for my job, and I enjoy communication with other people.
English is a tool for communication.
Don't be afraid!
Use English!
You can be a good speaker of English.
Mr. Suzuki is a non-native speaker of English.
He uses English for his job.
In meetings, he uses English as a communication tool.
When he can't understand others, he always asks questions.
He enjoys communication with other people in English.
