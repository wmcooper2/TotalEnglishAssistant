Hello, everyone.
I'm going to talk about my dream.
I want to be a chef in the future.
I love cooking.
I cook dinner for my family every weekend.
My family especially loves my tempura.
My dream is to have my own Japanese restaurant overseas some day.
I want to serve my dishes to customers from all over the world.
I hope everybody will enjoy my dishes.
I'll do my best to be a great chef.
Thank you.
