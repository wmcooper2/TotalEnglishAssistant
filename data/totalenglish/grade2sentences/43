My brother Toshiki is a university student.
He is studying English.
He is going to study in Los Angeles during summer vacation.
I asked him, "What are you going to do in Los Angeles?"
He answered, "I'm going to stay at my English teacher's house and study drama."
Toshiki is very interested in movies, so I think he will work in Hollywood some day.
Toshiki is a junior high school student.
Toshiki is going to stay at his teacher's house in Los Angeles.
Toshiki is going to study drama during the summer vacation.
Kazu doesn't think Toshiki will work in Hollywood some day.
What are you going to do after school today?
What are you going to do next Sunday?
What will you do during the summer vacation?
