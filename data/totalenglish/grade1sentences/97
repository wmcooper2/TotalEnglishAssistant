Whose cap is this?
Excuse me.
Is this yours?
Oh, no.
It's not mine.
It's Hana's.
Oh, no.
It's too big for me.
Sorry.
Excuse me, Hana.
Is this yours?
No.
It's Ken's.
Oh, it's his.
Oh, it's mine!
Thank you.
Excuse me, Ken.
Is this yours?
No. It's the Zosan Brothers'.
Oh, it's theirs.
Excuse me.
Is this yours?
No.
It's not ours.
Then, whose cap is this?
