Well, you have a lot of things to learn.
What do I have to learn?
Music, Japanese, English, math, science and many other things are important for a teacher.
Wow, I have to study a lot to become a music teacher.
You also need to practice the piano.
Last summer, I went to Australia to learn about unique animals.
I have some pictures of them to show you.
Wow, cute!
I hope to visit Australia in the near future, and I want to take wonderful pictures like these.
