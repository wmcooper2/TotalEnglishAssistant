Both the Nazca Lines and Machu Picchu are popular World Heritage Sties in Peru.
But for me, Machu Picchu is more interesting than the Nazca Lines.
Machu Picchu was an ancient city in the Andes.
It is about 2,400 meters above sea level.
How and why did the people build the city in such a high place?
Why did the people disappear?
I want to solve theses mysteries some day.
I think that Machu Picchu is the most mysterious place in the world.
How high is Machu Picchu?
