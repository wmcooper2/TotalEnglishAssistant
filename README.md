# Total English Assistant
This is a GUI and CLI tool.  
It is intended to be a supplement to the "Total English" book series.  
This textbook series is (in 2019) taught in many of Japan's middle schools.  
_Low priority project. I learned what I wanted to learn from this project and now I need to move on. I don't intend to continue working aggressively on this one._

See the [wiki](https://github.com/wmcooper2/TotalEnglishAssistant/wiki) for more info.

Here is a combined screenshot of the CLI and GUI versions.
