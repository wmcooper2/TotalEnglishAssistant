You look sleepy, Miku.
Yes.
I stayed up late last nigh.
Were you studying?
No, I wasn't.
I was reading a book.
It was about gestures in different countries.
Gestures?
I'm really interested in gestures.
Do you know this gesture, Hiro?
Of course.
We do that for "Come here."
To Americans, that looks like the gesture for "Go away."
Really?
Yes.
We do this for "Come here."
Wow, I learned something new today.
What was Miku reading last night?
