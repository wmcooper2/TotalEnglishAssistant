Ann invited me to her party next Sunday.
Why don't you come with me?
OK.
That sounds great.
See you later.
Bye.
Bye.
Can I borrow your new book?
Sure, I can lend it to you.
I'll bring it to your house tomorrow.
Great!
Thanks.
See you tomorrow.
Bye.
Bye.
Is Pat there, please?
I think you have the wrong number.
