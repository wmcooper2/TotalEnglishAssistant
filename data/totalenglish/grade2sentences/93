One day, Blue Demon came to Red Demon's house.
He said, "Do you really want to be friends with children?"
Red Demon said, "Yes, I do."
OK.
"I have an idea," Blue Demon said.
Red Demon listened to his idea and said, "That's a good idea, but you may have a hard time."
"Don't worry," Blue Demon said.
Then, they went down to the village.
