Shall we go to the zoo this Saturday?
Great idea.
Do we have to take the underground?
No.
We can take a taxi from here.
Shall I bring lunch for us?
Thank you.
Could you bring a camera, too?
Sure.
Let's take some pictures with the animals.
May I go to Ken's house this afternoon?
You must do your homework first.
Could you help me?
No.
You must do it by yourself.
