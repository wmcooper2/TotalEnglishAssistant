Hello.
This is Hiro.
Can I speak to Ben?
Speaking.
What's up?
Are you busy now?
I'm looking at the stars through my telescope.
The sky is so beautiful tonight.
Really?
Can I come and look at the stars with you?
Sure.
Come over right now.
OK.
See you soon.
Who can come and look at the stars with Ben?
