 I like anime better than Western animation.
 What anime do you like the best?
 I like "One Piece" the best.
 How about manga?

 Why?
 Because I can read them more easily than manga.
 What do you mean?
 You know, we read books from left to right.
 But when we read manga, we must read from right to left.
 Which does Ms. Allen like better, manga or Western comics?
