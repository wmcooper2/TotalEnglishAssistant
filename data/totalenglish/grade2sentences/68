I like kids.
So I want to go to a nursery school for my career experience.
Where do you want to go?
I don't know yet.
I need to think bout it.
What do you like to do?
Uh, I like to talk with people.
Well, my aunt and her husband run a supermarket.
You're a friendly person.
How about a job there?
That sounds good!
Where does Seema want to go for her career experience?
