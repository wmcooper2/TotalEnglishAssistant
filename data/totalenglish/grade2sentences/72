Dear Ms. Gupta, thank you for the wonderful experience at your shop.
I really enjoyed it.
We had a lot of things to learn.
At first, I couldn't greet customers in a loud voice.
But by the end of the day, I did it well.
I tried hard to help the customers.
When I helped them, they said "thank you" to me.
I felt happy.
I hope to serve people in my future career.
I want to see many happy faces.
Than you again for this great experience.
What did Miku do well by the end of the day?
