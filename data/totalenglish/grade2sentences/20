How do you point to yourself, Hiro?
I point to my nose like this.
We usually put a hand on our chest.
Oh, that's interesting.
Do you know the Bulgarian gestures for "yes" and "no"?
No, I don't.
Me, neither.
When they say "yes," they shake their head.
When they say "no," they nod their head.
Wow!
Those gestures are opposite to ours!
Do Bulgarians nod their head when they say "yes"?
