Dear Hiro, I arrived in Gold Coast, Australia, two days ago.
It's summer here now.
My sister and I walked along the beach.
We visited a wildlife sanctuary yesterday.
Many animals live there.
Please enjoy these pictures.
We're going to a national park tomorrow.
Your friend, Ben.
What season is it in Australia?
