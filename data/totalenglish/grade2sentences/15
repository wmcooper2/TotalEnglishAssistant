 I watched sumo matches on TV yesterday evening.
 My favorite sumo wrestler won a match with a tall heavy wrestler, but he moved very fast like a rabbit on the dohyo.
 I was very excited.
 Many sumo fans were also excited.
 After the match, he talked on TV.
 He looked very happy.
 Alex watched sumo on TV yesterday.
 Alex's favorite sumo wrestler is very tall and heavy.
 Alex was excited about the sumo match.
 Many sumo fans were not excited.
 Where were you last Sunday afternoon?
 What did you do there?
 How was it?
