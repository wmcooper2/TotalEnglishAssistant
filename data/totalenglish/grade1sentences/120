I went to Australia last month.
I saw some unique animals there.
First, look at these pictures.
Mother kangaroos and koalas have pouches.
They carry their babies in them.
Next, this is a picture of an emu.
Emus can't fly, but they can run 40 kilometers an hour.
Now, these are glow-worms.
They attract other insects with their light and catch them.
I'm very interested in these unique animals.
How fast can emus run?
