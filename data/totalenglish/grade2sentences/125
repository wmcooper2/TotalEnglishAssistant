Sister Teresa began teaching children in the poor part of the city.
There were no desks, no chairs and no boards.
She wrote letters and numbers on the ground.
She also took care of hungry and sick people.
She went from door to door to get food for them.
Some time later, one of her old students wanted to join Sister Teresa's work.
Sister Teresa told her, "This work is not easy."
You must live for others.
Her student started to work with Teresa and in time many others did as well.
