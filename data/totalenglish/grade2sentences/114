Me, too.
I became interested in Japanese culture after watching Kurosawa's movies.
What's your favorite movie, Hiro?
Star Wars.
I like American movies.
Do you know Kurosawa's samurai movies influenced "Star Wars"?
Oh, I remember!
In "Star Wars," the warriors fight with swords like katana.
If you like moves you should watch Japanese movies, too.
