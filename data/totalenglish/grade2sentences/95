A few days later, Red Demon went to the Blue Demon's house to thank him.
Red Demon found a letter on the door.
Dear Red Demon, I'm glad you have many new friends now.
I want to see you again, but I'm afraid I'll scare your new friends.
So, I'll go far away.
I'll always be your friend.
Goodbye, Blue Demon.
Red Demon read it many times.
He cried.
He never saw Blue Demon again.
