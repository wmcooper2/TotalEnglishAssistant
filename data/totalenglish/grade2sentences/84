Why do you look so happy?
Because my uncle gave me a camera.
Really?
I enjoy taking pictures every day.
What do you take pictures of?
Flowers.
I'll show you some of them.
I think that learning gestures in different countries is important.
Why do you think so?
Because different gestures have different meanings in different countries.
Could you show me some examples?
