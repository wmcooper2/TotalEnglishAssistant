You don't look well, Pat.
What's wrong?
I feel sick.
That's too bad.
You should see a doctor.
May I help you?
I need something for a cold.
I have a fever and a headache.
Take this medicine after each meal.
Thanks.
Are you all right?
You should rest.
Take care.
I have a pain here.
You should see a dentist.
My leg still hurts.
